This dataset is particularly useful because the entire observation period predates effective tuberculosis treatment, eliminating this as a time-varying confounder. As a result, differences in survival can be interpreted as reflecting underlying demographic, environmental, and service-related factors rather than changes in treatment access or efficacy.
